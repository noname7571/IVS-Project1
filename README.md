# IVS Project 1

## Project Overview

The primary focus of this project is about implementing black-box testing, white-box testing, and following the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD).  

## Testing Approach

### Black-Box Testing

Black-box testing focuses on the external behavior of the system without knowledge of its internal implementation. Test cases were designed based on specifications, requirements, and user expectations. This ensures that the application functions correctly from an end-user perspective.

### White-Box Testing

White-box testing involves examining the internal logic and code structure of the application. Test cases were designed to ensure that all branches, paths, and conditions are tested, promoting code coverage and robustness.

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

TDD is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code. The cycle involves:  
1. Writing a failing test.  
2. Implementing the minimum code necessary to pass the test.  
3. Refactoring the code while keeping it functional.  

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project successfully implemented both black-box and white-box testing strategies, ensuring a comprehensive testing approach. Test-Driven Development practices were followed, resulting in a more reliable and maintainable codebase.
